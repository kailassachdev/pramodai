[build]
  # Command to build your Next.js site.
  # Your package.json has "build": "next build", so "npm run build" is appropriate.
  command = "npm run build"

  # Directory (relative to root of your repo) that contains the deploy-ready
  # HTML files and assets generated by the build. For Next.js, this is .next/

# The Netlify Next.js plugin is essential for full support of Next.js features
# like server-side rendering, API routes, image optimization, etc.
# It's often auto-installed if Netlify detects a Next.js app,
# but explicitly adding it here ensures it's used.
